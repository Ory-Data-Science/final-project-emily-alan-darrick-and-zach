The Data that we have chosen to analyze and organize for our final project is a public database provided by the State of California Department of Justice and is collected by the Controlled Substance and Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES). CURES is the statewide controlled substance monitoring program, and it collects all data on schedule II - V drugs that are dispensed in the state of California. The speific data set that we selected from the CURES archives containes mostly quantitative data which we thought would be more easily categorized and organized than other qualitative studies. 

Our main question for this project is to evaluate if the safety of dispensing controlled drugs in the state of california has improved over time by comparing first of all the data year to year, and then summarizing the quantities of different levels of controlled drugs. We want to explore this question because we can also look deeper into the data to compare the dispensation over different age groups to ensure providers aren't over prescribing to children or geriatric patients.
