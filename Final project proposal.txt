Project Proposal

	The Data that we have chosen to analyze and organize for our final project is a public database provided by the State of California Department of Justice and is collected by the Controlled Substance and Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES). CURES is the statewide controlled substance monitoring program, and it collects all data on schedule II - V drugs that are dispensed in the state of California. The speific data set that we selected from the CURES archives containes mostly quantitative data which we thought would be more easily categorized and organized than other qualitative studies. 
	The data is a compilation of the year, schedule type (II-V), day, month, time, pill count dispensed, and the age group of the patient. We feel that SQL lite would be the most appropriate tool to use for the project. The data is simply recorded by CURES but does not show any correlations or trends about the prescriptions included in the file. SQL lite is a great tool for bringing correlations and visualizations to data, and will make the overall comparisons more comprehensive when we present it. An example of a trend that we would like to explore would be to see which age groups are consuming the highest quantity of tablets/capsules per prescription and does this reflect an increase with age like we would expect? Another interesting chart would be if the total number of controlled drugs has increased or decreased between the data from 2016 to 2017.
